# Introduction
It's easy for people to get lost in a complex of buildings, especially in a scenic area where there are many layered and intricate spaces, interweaving corridors, and interlocking structures. A clear and informative map can help people find their destinations more quickly, but a 2D map fails to intuitively represent different levels and structures.

An ideal map should be physically interactive and capable of presenting three-dimensional information. To meet these needs, I propose an innovative approach to map creation: using a three-dimensional origami structure to build a foldable 3D map. This method maintains the portability of a traditional 2D paper map while providing more information about the three-dimensional space, aligning more closely with user intuition.
